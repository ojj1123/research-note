5. When did you last go to a coffee shop? And how long did you wait in line to order?
	The last time I went to a coffee shop was yesterday / two weeks ago
	And I waited about 5 minutes in line to order 
6. Other than coffee, what would you like a coffee shop to serve, and why?
	I would like a coffee shop to serve a piece of cake
	because it's good to go well with coffee
7. If a new coffee shop opened in your town, do you think it would be successfull? Why or why not?
	I think it would be successfull. First it will have great and new facility so people will like it. And 
	 most coffee shop in my town is old so I think it's good to have new ones.
